## Introduction
The website is developed as part of coursework of "Adaptive Application" module in Trinity College Dublin (TCD).
The team developed a novel work by improving the method used by MOOC for providing the tutorials. Currently, there are various on-going research in MOOC like ahMOOC, aMOOC, iMOOC. However, these provide generic improvement related to the whole system. In our project, we developed the adaptive model to understand the user's learning rate and modifying the tutorial pace accordingly.
